| **Challenge**                         | **Description**                                                                   | **Solution Implemented**                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Maintaining Responsive Design**  | Ensuring that the layout looks good across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). | Used **Bootstrap’s grid system** (`row`, `col`, `container`) and tested with browser dev tools for different screen sizes. |
| **2. Image Quality and Loading Time** | High-resolution images made pages load slower.                                    | Compressed and optimized **Unsplash** images using `auto=format&fit=crop&w=1400&q=80` parameters.                          |
| **3. Navbar Collapsing on Mobile**    | Navigation bar was overlapping with content on small screens.                     | Used Bootstrap’s **navbar-expand-lg** and **collapse** features to toggle menu smoothly.                                   |
| **4. Carousel Caption Readability**   | Text over light backgrounds wasn’t always visible.                                | Added a **dark transparent background overlay** to the carousel captions using `rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` in CSS.                  |
| **5. Contact Form Functionality**     | Wanted a working form without a backend.                                          | Implemented a **JavaScript alert** to simulate submission and confirm user interaction.                                    |
| **6. Content Layout Consistency**     | Cards and text alignment were uneven on different pages.                          | Used **Bootstrap cards and spacing utilities** to standardize margins, padding, and alignment.                             |
